# COM202-FinalProject
Final project for my COM202 course from 2020-2021. This was a Java game engine developed over the course of around 3 weeks (although most of the development took place in the last 3 days lol).
# Personal Thoughts
I tried to develop this with the mindset of making the project as flexable as possible and to practice OOP concepts. The project contains multiple levels of inheritance and uses interfaces and abstract classes to achieve polymorphism.

However, this caused me to not focus as much on the implementation level of things, which caused me to make a few bad design choices such as giving responsibility of object AI to the Controller class as opposed to a separate AI class (although I was half asleep by the time I implemented these features). Additionally, object interaction could be worked on.

One thing I'm most proud of is how easy it is to implement games - it only takes around a hundred lines and new objects can be easily added. Additionally, I'm happy that the project works as expected, and that I've not seen any bugs (so far).
